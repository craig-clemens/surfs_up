# surfs_up
 
 ## Overview
The goal here was to create a generalized statistical analysis of the temperature of the island of Oahu during the peak season (June) and down season (December). This information would allow us to accuractly measure the sustainability of a surf and ice cream shop year round.
## Results and Temperature Anaylsis
### June

Based on the 1,700 observations for the month of June between the years 2010 and 2017, we can summize that with a small standard deviation of the temperature does not stray significantly from the mean of 74.94 degrees very often. Thus our surf and ice cream shop will be able to largely expect nice, warm weather throughout the month of June.
### December

Although the month of December has less data points to choose from - some 183 less than June - we can still rely on this data to be accurate as it remains a large enough sample size. December has, again, reliably warm and stable weather patterns. With a mean of 71.04 degrees and a standard deviation of only 3.74 degrees, weather in December is warm and stable enough to rent surf boards and sell ice cream.
## Summary
In conclusion, we can firmly state that temperature patterns remain stable throughout the year. If warm, stable weather is the only factor to predict reliable business than this surf and ice cream parlor would be highly sustainable in the short- and long-term. However, further queries and analysis should also be completeded for other weather factors - wind, rain, and cloudiness, specifically. Doing further statistical analysis on other weather patterns will either confirm our hypothesis or offer greater insight into the viability of the business.
